# Smaller H100 prefill chunk pair submitted

## Smaller H100 prefill chunks submitted — 2026-10-20T12:06:14.504964+00:00

**H100 222382 R → 222383 H**, verified afterany pair: fresh chunk 4096 control versus chunk 2048 at fixed both-phase HPC-Ops, round-robin routing and N54. All other execution/observation/output/transport paths match accepted 222302. Exact pinned graph generator and negative fixtures validate the expected smaller prefill graph range; actual runtime and performance remain unmeasured. [Plan, receipts, gates and next review](/home/apacsc42/2026-APAC-HPC-AI/qwen-experiments/h100-hpc-smallchunk-20261020/PLAN.md).

Prior routing pair full local PASS but power-of-two loses 4.865% (2396.201520 → 2279.626751 good output tokens/s); retain round-robin. Both charges reconcile. Pre-submit Used 39307.091 SU, Balance 24692.909, In Doubt zero; reserve 3072 SU maximum, internal headroom 8620.909 under unchanged 51000 cap/13000 buffer. H200 four model jobs plus repaired micro 25020 are pending, total five; no model position cancelled. Peaks unchanged, official accuracy unverified. No package, auth or background AI change. Earlier scheduler and credit snapshots below are historical.

Collect terminal snapshots, verify exact derived graphs and every local gate, inspect tails/role state/hardware/logs/cost, then decide. No performance claim yet.
